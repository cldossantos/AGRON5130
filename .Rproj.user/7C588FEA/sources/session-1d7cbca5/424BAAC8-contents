# Installing R and RStudio

This guide walks you through installing **R** (the programming language) and
**RStudio** (the integrated development environment, IDE) on your computer.
Please follow the steps carefully **in the order shown**.

> **Important:** R and RStudio are separate programs. You must install **R**
> first, then **RStudio**.

---

## 1. What You Will Install

- **R**: The statistical computing language that runs your code
- **RStudio**: A user-friendly interface that makes working with R much easier

Both are **free and open source**.

---

## 2. Check Your Operating System

Before starting, confirm which operating system you are using:

- **Windows** (Windows 10 or 11)
- **macOS** (Mac)
- **Linux** (Ubuntu or similar distributions)

The installation steps differ slightly for each system.

## 3. Installation workflow

As of today, the latest stable version released of R is 
version 4.5.2. It is possible that when you actually use this
guide, the version numbeer might differ slightly. That should not
be a problem and should not change this workflow.
