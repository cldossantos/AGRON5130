# Question 1a

Load the peanut_uniformity dataset and assign it to the dataset "peanut".

```{r}

```

# Question 1b

Review the dataset using the *head()* function.

```{r}

```

# Question 1d

Create a quick histogram of yield using the *hist()* function.

```{r}

```

# Question 1e

Calculate the mean yield and assign it to the variable "peanut_mu". Calculate the standard deviation of the yield and assign it to the variable "peanut_sigma".

```{r}

```

# Question 1f

Plot the distribution and calculate the probability of yields less than 1.5.

```{r}
library(fastGraph)

```

# Question 1g

Calculate the probability of values greater than 3.5.

```{r}

```

Question 1h Calculate the probability of values equal or greater than 1.6 and less than 2.9.

```{r}

```

# Question 2a

Load the file "data/merriweather_yield_map/merriweather_yield_map.shp" using the *st_read()* function and assign it to the soybean dataframe.

```{r}
library(sf)

```

# Question 2b

Review the data using the *head()* function.

```{r}

```

# Question 2c

Plot a map for the "yield_bu" column of the soybean dataset

```{r}

```

# Question 2d

Create a simple histogram of "yield_bu" using the *hist()* function

```{r}

```

# Question 2e

Calculate the mean yield and call it "soybean_mu". Calculate the standard deviation of yield and call it "soybean sigma".

```{r}

```

# Question 2f

What is the probability of observing a yield equal to or greater than 90 bu/ac?

```{r}

```

# Question 2g

What is the probability of observing a yield between 75 and 85?

```{r}

```

# Question 2h

If the probability of observing a value less than 65.8 is 5%, about how many observations out of 100 would you expect to have a value less than or equal to 65.8.

```{r}
5/100 * 100
```
