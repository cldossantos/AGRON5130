# Question 1a
Load the peanut_uniformity dataset and assign it to the dataset "peanut".
```{r}
peanut = read.csv("data/peanut_uniformity.csv")
```


# Question 1b
Review the dataset using the *head()* function.
```{r}
head(peanut)
```

# Question 1d
Create a quick histogram of yield using the *hist()* function.
```{r}
hist(peanut$yield)
```

# Question 1e
Calculate the mean yield and assign it to the variable "peanut_mu".  Calculate the standard deviation of the yield and assign it to the variable "peanut_sigma". 
```{r}
peanut_mu = mean(peanut$yield)
peanut_sigma = sd(peanut$yield)

```

# Question 1f
Plot the distribution and calculate the probability of yields less than 1.5.
```{r}
library(fastGraph)

shadeDist(xshade = 1.5, 
          ddist = "dnorm", 
          parm1 = peanut_mu, 
          parm2 = peanut_sigma,
          lower.tail = TRUE)

```

# Question 1g
Calculate the probability of values greater than 3.5.
```{r}
shadeDist(xshade = 3.5, 
          ddist = "dnorm", 
          parm1 = peanut_mu, 
          parm2 = peanut_sigma,
          lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Question 1h
Calculate the probability of values equal or greater than 1.6 and less than 2.9.
```{r}
shadeDist(xshade = c(1.6,2.9), 
          ddist = "dnorm", 
          parm1 = peanut_mu, 
          parm2 = peanut_sigma,
          lower.tail = FALSE)
```

# Question 2a
Load the file "data/merriweather_yield_map/merriweather_yield_map.shp" using the *st_read()* function and assign it to the soybean dataframe.
```{r}
library(sf)
soybean = st_read("data/merriweather_yield_map/merriweather_yield_map.shp")

```

# Question 2b
Review the data using the *head()* function.
```{r}
head(soybean)
```

# Question 2c
Plot the "yield_bu" column of the soybean dataset
```{r}
plot(soybean["yield_bu"])
```

# Question 2d
Create a simple histogram of "yield_bu" using the *hist()* function
```{r}
hist(soybean$yield_bu)
```

# Question 2e
Calculate the mean yield and call it "soybean_mu".  Calculate the standard deviation of yield and call it "soybean sigma".
```{r}
soybean_mu = mean(soybean$yield_bu)
soybean_sigma = sd(soybean$yield_bu)

```

# Question 2f
What is the probability of observing a yield equal to or greater than 90 bu/ac?
```{r}
shadeDist(xshade = 90, 
          ddist = "dnorm", 
          parm1 = soybean_mu, 
          parm2 = soybean_sigma,
          lower.tail = FALSE)
```

# Question 2g
What is the probability of observing a yield between 75 and 85?
```{r}
shadeDist(xshade = c(75,85), 
          ddist = "dnorm", 
          parm1 = soybean_mu, 
          parm2 = soybean_sigma,
          lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Question 2h
If the probability of observing a value less than 65.8 is 5%, about how many observations out of 100 would you expect to have a value less than or equal to 65.8.  
```{r}
soybean_mu - 1.64*soybean_sigma

```

```{r}
shadeDist(xshade = 65.75, 
          ddist = "dnorm", 
          parm1 = soybean_mu, 
          parm2 = soybean_sigma,
          lower.tail = TRUE)
```
