Please run this code so that you install the
necessary packages to generate a PDF output
correctly. I will go more in detail about packages
and libraries later in the semester, so please do
not worry about this part too much.

To run this code, please click on the green arrow
that points right

```{r}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
