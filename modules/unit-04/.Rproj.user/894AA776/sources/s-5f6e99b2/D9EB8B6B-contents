# Introduction
In the lesson, we discussed the importance of randomizing plots.  R has an incredibly easy


# Example 1
Create an experimental design with 4 replications of treatments "A" and "B".

## The Agricolae Package
To randomize two-treatment trials with paired treatments, we will use the "agricolae" package of R.  We first install agricolae and load it into our session.

```{r}
# install.packages("agricolae")
library(agricolae)
```

## Randomizing the Plot
We will use the "design.rcbd" function from the agricolae package.  We need to supply the following arguments to this function:
- trt: a vector with treatment names
- r: the number of replications

We will create a vector called "treatment_names", containing treatments "A" and "B".  We will use the argument r=4 to tell R to generate 4 blocks.

```{r}
treatment_name=c("A", "B")

plot_plan = design.rcbd(trt = treatment_name, r=4)

```

## Working with Lists
The code above created an object called "plot_plan".  So far in R we have dealt with two kinds of objects: a data frame, which is basically a table of values, and a vector, which can be thought of as a single column of numbers.  "treatment_names" above is an example of a vector.

"plot_plan" is a third type of R object, called a "list".  A list is a collection of other R objects.  It can contain multiple data frames, vectors, single values, etc.  A list is a very useful way to bundle up information, but they can be a little tricky to unpack.

If we just run plot_plan below, we will get two windows.  One will list all of the objects in the list.  The second window will show the plot plan.

```{r}
plot_plan
```

We can access this information more directly.  If we type "plot_plan$sketch", we get a plot map of sorts.

```{r}
plot_plan$sketch


```

If we type "plot_plan$book", we get a data frame with the plots, block, and treatment_names.

```{r}
plot_plan$book
```

# Example 2
In a field trial, we wish to compare the biomass of two fiber hemp varieties, "Jerry" and "Bob".  We wish to design a paired experimental design with 10 replications.

```{r}
hemp_variety = c("Jerry", "Bob")

hemp_plot_plan = design.rcbd(trt = hemp_variety, r=10)
```

Here is the plot layout:
```{r}
hemp_plot_plan$sketch
```

And here is the table we can cut and paste into our spreadsheet:
```{r}
hemp_plot_plan$book
```
