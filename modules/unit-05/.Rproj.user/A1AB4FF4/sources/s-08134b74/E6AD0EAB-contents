# Introduction
For this exercise, we will not be analyzing data, but considering the relative importance of Type I and Type II Errors.  Please click "Run Document" (right above the word "Notebook" in the top line) and you will be presented with a quiz.


# Questions
For each question answer whether the researcher should be more concerned about a Type I or Type II Error.  Remember, a Type I Error occurs when we conclude from our sample means that two treatments are different, where if we were able to measure their populations we would see they are equal.  A Type II error occurs when we conclude from our sample means that two treatments are the same, when in fact their populations are different.

  question("Question 1: You are in the final year of evaluating a new hybrid that will cost the grower $20 more per acre, 
           and will increase yield about 6 bushels ($22.20 at the market price of $3.70 per bushel).  (An ROI of means the farmer will earn $3 per acre after the increased cost of the seed.)  Would you worry more about a Type I or Type II error?",
           answer("Type I", correct=TRUE),
           answer("Type II"),
           correct = "Correct.  The reward if the new hybrid is better than the old hybrid is relatively small at 1 bushel, or $2.20.  
           If the yield difference is just a little bit less than 6 bu/ac, however, the grower will lose money by planting the new
           hybrid."
  ),
  question("Question 2: You are in the early stages of a soybean breeding program.  In testing, a 
           new variety yielded 5 bushels more per acre but was only better than existing varieties at p=0.8.  
           The new variety would have a cost per acre comparable to the old varieties and could be very popular with growers.  
           The market price per bushel of soybean is $8.24.
           Would you worry more a Type I or Type II error?",
           answer("Type I"),
           answer("Type II", correct=TRUE),
           correct = "Correct.  The new variety yielded 5 bu/ac greater than existing varieties.  
           This difference was not significant at the p=0.05 level, but it was observed and might be significant in a different trial.  
           To boot, there would be little cost to the grower to plant the new variety.
           Finally, this is an early trial in the development of the variety.  If it fails to perform as well in subsequent trials,
           it can be removed from the seed catalog prior to release."
  ),
  question("Question 3: You are developing a new vaccine for COVID-19.  You are testing for the frequency of severe, life-threatening 
  side effects (high blood pressure, heart arrythmia, kidney failure) in patients who receive the vaccine, versus those who are untreated.
  Would you worry more about a Type I or Type II error?",
           answer("Type I"),
           answer("Type II", correct=TRUE),
           correct = "Correct.  If we wrongly conclude the incidence of these life-threatening conditions in persons who receive 
           the vaccine is the same as those who are untreated, we will endanger the lives of those receiving the vaccine."
  ),
  question("Question 4: You are developing a new vaccine for COVID-19.  
           The vaccine is expensive ($500 and not covered by insurance),
           If it doesn't work, recipients will falsely believe they are not susceptible to COVID.  
           Presence of COVID-19 antibodies and symptoms are compared between populations treated and untreated with the vaccine. 
           Would you worry more about a Type I or Type II error?",
           answer("Type I", correct = TRUE),
           answer("Type II"),
           correct = "Correct.  The cost of concluding there is a increase in antibodies or decrease in COVID incidence based on samples,
           when the populations are actually equal, could be disasterous.  Patients will have paid for an expensive treatment.
           Even worse, they may place themselves in susceptible situations they would have otherwise avoided.")
