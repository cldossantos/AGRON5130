This component is on depressions on till plains, till plains. The parent material consists of Wisconsin till derived from limestone and shale. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is very poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is frequently ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 6 inches during January, February, March, April, May, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 4 percent. This component is in the F111BY501IN Till Depression ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.   ",20682960,20836897
