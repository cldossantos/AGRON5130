This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.
This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
</abstract><purpose>
SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.
</purpose><supplinf>
Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.

derived from these data.
This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.
Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
</attraccr></attracc><logic>
Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.
The Soil Survey of (OH011) Auglaize County, Ohio is edge matched to
the adjacent SSURGO certified soil surveys:
OH161  Van Wert County, Ohio
OH003  Allen County, Ohio
OH065  Hardin County, Ohio
OH091  Logan County, Ohio
OH149  Shelby County, Ohio
OH107  Mercer County, Ohio
Most feature edges (polygon and line segments) match adjacent ones
in the edge matched survey areas, however, most feature labels don't
match the adjacent feature labels in edge matched surveys.
The soil survey area boundary for Auglaize County matches the soil
survey area boundary for the adjacent certified soil surveys.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
on the map is a delineation.
Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
named soils in the surrounding a map unit. These minor components
may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they many
not be indicated on the map.
A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
(map unit components), each with a designated range in
proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
or no recognizable soil.
Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
(current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.
The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.
Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
significantly affect the use the map unit. The total amount of
dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.
Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
complex or association is used in the name. The major components
of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
each major component is normally present though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.
Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that are not consistently associated
geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
the same map delineation. These components are included in the
same named map unit because their use and management are the same
or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
undifferentiated groups as to consociations.
Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.
A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 2.0 acres.

The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map
Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.
For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.

Field procedures for the second order soil survey
included plotting of soil boundaries determined by field observations in conjunction with aerial photo interpretation.  Boundaries were verified at closely spaced intervals and the soils in each delineation were identified by traversing and transecting the landscape.  Soil Scientists described and analyzed the data.  The classification and map unit names were finalized at the final correlation conference in 1978 and signed in 1979.  The published soil survey report was released in 1981.

For each publication mapsheet, the original soil delineation overlay,
special soil features overlay and photo background overlay were scanned
by Draft-Co. Inc., Martins Ferry, Ohio.  Each photo overlay was then
aligned with its corresponding special features and soil delineation
overlay in the CAD environment.  This align was followed by a digital
orthorectification process (SYRUP- Simple Yet Robust Universal
Parametric-Orthorectification).  Inputs into the model include the
scanned and registered soil delineation overlays, special soil features
overlays, and photo background overlays, as well as standard 1-meter
resolution USGS digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ), and a standard
USGS 30-meter, seamless Digital Elevation Model (DEM).  The first step
in the SYRUP process is to obtain sufficient ground control points
(GCPs) between each mapsheet overlay and its corresponding DOQQs.
This is performed using ERDAS Imagine software (ERDAS, Inc., 2001).
GCPs are recorded in a text file along with their associated elevation
values gathered from the DEM and are input into the SYRUP model.
The root mean square error (RMSE) of each individual control point and
the average RMSE of all control points were calculated using X-file and
Y-file coordinates, X-ground and Y-ground coordinates, and Z-elevation
values. The RMSE describes the deviation between the actual location of
a GCP and the value calculated by the transformation and must be lower
than 10.00 for each mapsheet.  The RMSE values were calculated by the
ERDAS Imagine software, based on a two-dimensional registration,
because this was the only type of registration ERDAS Imagine provides.
Since a three dimensional registration (SYRUP) was being applied to
the data, a specific RMSE value to be used as a 'breakpoint' value for
quality control purposes was not appropriate in this case.  Rather,
relative values were compared and used as an index to flag certain
areas for further spatial examination and GCP adjustment.  A spatial
measurement was used as a rigid indicator of quality control.  This is
a measurement of the distance between mapsheet overlay locations after
ortho-rectification and their corresponding DOQQ locations.  Distance
measurements were examined at extremely large scales (1:1000 or larger)
to assure compliance with minimum USGS National Map Accuracy Standards
(NMAS).  The SYRUP extension to ERDAS Imagine uses a statistical model
involving a statistical approximation to produce a geometrically correct
version of each publication mapsheet overlay.  Resulting images were
also visually compared with corresponding DOQQ images using the Swipe
tool in ERDAS Imagine for quality.  Problem areas in need of increased
quality were edited by adding and/or adjusting control points where
needed.  These areas can them be processed through the SYRUP model once
again.   ERDAS Imagine was then used to convert the raster image (*.img)
file format to .grid raster file format for viewing in ARC/INFO.  The
raster, soil delineation layer was then converted to a binary, raster
.tif using AutoCAD.  Hitachi software in a CAD environment was used to
convert the binary raster lines into vector lines.  AutoCAD software
was used to clean vector lines and attribute the soil polygons with
their appropriate soil map unit symbols.  The clean lines were then
'splined' using a quadratic B-spline in AutoCAD software and
'generalized' using ESRI software.  Bodies of water were aligned to the
ortho photo image except for areas less than 2 acres in size.  Areas
less than 2 acres in size were shown as a point special feature labeled
'WAT'.  Most errors found on the published soil maps were corrected by
a soil scientist who referred to copies of the original soil survey
field sheets.  A few errors were field checked by soil scientists and
corrected.  The orthorectified symbol/feature overlays were used as a
background reference image to determine which map unit symbols were
associated with which soil polygons.  Special soil features were also
digitized and attributed as separate point and line coverages using
AutoCAD.  Cultural features are then exported out of AutoCad with the
appropriate object data attached to each feature.  The line work and
symbols are processed using a series of queries and spatial joins in
MapInfo.  The formed polygons are then returned to AutoCad and written
out as an ARC/INFO coverage for a final product.  Quality assurance
and quality control was conducted by the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR).  All Soil Line placements and labels were checked and
verified.  In addition, label placement locations for soil polygons
were moved to the centroid of polygons where possible or to other
locations to prevent the overlap of labels from adjoining polygons and
special features.  ARC/INFO software was used to edge match quarter
quadrangles of soil data which were then merged into a county-wide
layer.  This coverage is presently being reviewed by the USDA, Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) for compliance with SSURGO
standards.  This review may require that some changes be made to
the data.

The Michigan Digitizing Unit (MIDU) staff downloaded the SSURGO data
for Auglaize County and the adjacent surveys from the Soil Data
Warehouse (SDW).  The MIDU staff imported the coverages into a
geodatabase and checked the spatial data with the ARCGIS Version 9.2
software.  To remove excess vertices, the soil boundaries were
generalized at a tolerance of 0.5 meters.  The boundaries of this soil
survey were adjusted to match the boundaries of the adjacent soil
surveys at a tolerance of 0.1 meters.  After the soil survey was
edited, the area, line and point feature classes were converted to
ARC/INFO coverages and exported as e00 files.  The digital maps of the
mapping units and the special soil features were imported into the
ARC/INFO Version 7.2.1 software for review and certification.  The
MIDU staff checked the data with a set of ARC Macro Language (AML)
programs developed by the NCGC.  The seamless coverages were checked
using the January 2006 SSURGO Evaluation AML programs.  The labels in
the spatial data matched the symbols in the mapunit table from NASIS.
Upon successful completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the county
coverages, feature file and the metadata were electronically
transferred to the NRCS Staging Server to be joined with
the tabular data.

The spatial data underwent a quality control review by soil and
cartographic staff at the Findlay, OH MLRA Soil Survey Office.
Cartographic edits for the recorrelation projects were made to a SSURGO
certified dataset downloaded from the Soil Data Mart, August 2011 using
ArcGIS 9.3.  Most spatial edits for the recorrelation projects were made
to change mapunit symbols for recorrelated mapunits and a few edits were
made to some county data sets to create new mapunit polygons.  In
addition, some line work was done to fix polygon join problems at county
and state boundaries for soil map units included in the recorrelation
projects.  Line edits were made with reference to 2006 MrSID (OH) and
2010 NAIP (OH &amp; IN) orthophotography. Cartographic staff made checks and
edits for topologic errors that included common lines and points and
slivers. After a quality assurance review was completed by regional
staff, the seamless county geodatabase for the soil surveys was forwarded
to the certification team at the Michigan Digitizing Unit (MIDU) in
East Lansing, Michigan.
Project: MLRA 111B OH&amp;IN Glynwood/Morley C-slopes; FYs 2009-2011
Initiated to harmonize soil mapunit names and data across MLRA 111B for
glacial till soils on C-slopes.
Early soil surveys in MLRA 111B correlated consociations of Morley
series as both moderately well drained and well drained phases. Glynwood
soil series was later established to replace the moderately well drained
phase, thereby restricting the Morley series to the well drained phase.
Both series were subsequently correlated as consociations on C-slopes.
Soil mapunit transects were completed on 23 map units in 14 counties to
determine map unit composition.  Glynwood soils were found to be the
predominant component in all mapunits. Summaries of the transect data
were used to update tabular data.  Mapunit composition was shown to vary
between ground moraines and end moraines on the till plain, so map unit
phases were developed for both landforms.  Erosion class designations
from the published surveys were retained in the recorrelation.  The 23
map units from non-MLRA areas were recorrelated to 6 regional mapunits
for MLRA 111B.  Approved at the August 2011 project completion review.
Project: MLRA 111B OH&amp;IN Montgomery Soils; FYs 2009-2011
Initiated to evaluate Montgomery soils in MLRAs 111B and 111E on lake
plains, till plains, outwash valleys and flood plains.
Mapunit transect data was gathered for 24 mapunits in 14 counties.  The
Montgomery series was reclassified to a vertic great group.  Soils in
this region are not thought to have vertic properties but sample data is
needed to properly classify these soils.   Minster series was established
to replace soils previously mapped as Montgomery series.  Minster series
classifies as Fine, mixed, active, mesic Typic Endoaquolls.  Substratum
phases of Minster map units were created for areas occurring on till
plains and outwash valleys.  Soils on flood plains were recorrelated to
the Saranac series.	The 24 mapunits from non-MLRA areas were
recorrelated into 4 regional map units in MLRAs 111B and 111E. Approved
at the August 2011 project completion review.
Project: MLRA 111B OH&amp;IN Flood Plains; St. Marys &amp; Wabash R. Watersheds;
FYs 2010-2011
Initiated to harmonize soil mapunit names and data for poorly drained
flood plain soils in the Saint Marys River and Upper Wabash River
watersheds.
Mapunit transects were completed for 18 mapunits in portions of 8
counties. Six different soil series were studied.  Extensive mapunits of
Defiance soils along the St. Marys River were found to be a complex of
Saranac soils and a variant of Defiance soils.  This variant of Defiance
soils will be correlated to the  newly established Spencerville series.
Wabasha soils were recorrelated to Saranac soils base on a review of
historic data and transect borings.  Mapunit flooding phase differences
that occurred in the Shoals soils across county boundaries were improved
with a model that based flooding phases on stream morphological
characteristics. The 18 mapunits from non-MLRA areas and 6 series were
recorrelated to 6 regional map units for MLRA 111B and 5 series. Approved
at the August 2011 project completion review.

The spatial data for the entire SSURGO database was recertified in October
of 2019 to reduce storage requirements and to improve map display
and geoprocessing performance.  The SSURGO data is internally managed
using 12 Regional Transactional Spatial Databases (RTSD) that are in
an ESRI File Geodatabase format.  The spatial extent of the RTSDs follow the
Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD) regional administrative boundaries.
The XY coordinate system of this RTSD is USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area
Conic USGS Version WKID: 102039 and has an XY storage precision of 0.001
meters.  The RTSDs were recreated using a reduced storage precision of 0.1
meters to reduce the physical size of the data.  The SSURGO data was also
generalized by removing excess vertices, using a tolerance of 1 meter.

Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.
The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.
Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.
The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.
The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.
Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
