## Introduction to R programming

- [x] Installing R and R Studio
    - Windows  (Make sure to mention R Tools)
    - Mac

- [x] R Studio interface
    - Explain the interface and different panels
    - Explain the difference between a script and a markdown file
    - Explain difference between absolute and relative path
    - Explain how you want them to turn in the assignments on Canvas

- [x] Explain some important R terms
    - Mathematical operations
    - Vectors/Matrices
    - Functions

- [x] Assignment

## Population Statistics

- [x] Other important concepts
    - Data Frames
    - Indexing 
    - Basic data types
    - Importing a CSV file

- [x] R packages
    - Definition
    - Examples
    
- [ ]  Summary statistics
    - What is a population vs. a sample
    - Individuals and inference space
    - Why “what does this represent?” matters more than formulas
    - Mean vs. median
    - Variance vs. standard deviation (intuition only)
    - Percentiles and summaries
    - Light R usage is fine (summary()), but this is mostly explanation.

- [ ]  Histogram 
    - What a distribution is
    - Why we visualize before modeling
    - Histogram bins, width, midpoints
    - How bin width changes interpretation
    - Normal distribution overlay (conceptual only)
    - When a normal approximation is reasonable

- [ ]  Introduction to shapefiles
    - What a yield map actually represents
    - Why each observation has a location
    - What the geometry column means
    - What a shapefile is at a high level
    - Why spatial data changes how we think about populations
    - Preview: “We’ll learn how to work with these later”
